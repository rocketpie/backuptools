# WHAT? Yet another backup tool?

Yes. 

> And why not one of the existing ones? Borg, attic, restic, duplicity, zbackup ([from here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7004904/git-for-important-file-backup-why-not))

Because they feature a lot of great functionality that I do _not_ want: 

> Since the data is deduplicated, there's naturally no redundancy in it. A loss of a single file can lead to a loss of virtually all data. Make sure you store it on a redundant storage (RAID1, a cloud provider etc). ([here (Ctrl+F 'raid')](http://zbackup.org/))

> what _do_ you want?

To be able to restore when s**t hits the fan.  
more on details later.
